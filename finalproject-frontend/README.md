# TrailShare

## Run it, Ride it, Share it.

One of the most rewarding ways to experience a new environment is on the saddle of a bike or in your running shoes. Unfortunately, without local intel it can be hard to know which trails offer the most fun or the right level of challenge.

[TrailShare](http://sammylevin.com/trailshare) is a platform for discovering, saving, and navigating a neighborhood's best running and cycling trails.
